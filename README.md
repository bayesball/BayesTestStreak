# BayesTestStreak
Functions for detecting streakiness in binary response data

BayesTestStreak contains a collection of functions for comparing consistent and streaky models for a binary sequence using Bayes factors.  The methods are based on the group of spacings between consecutive successes.

The document https://bayesball.github.io/BayesTestStreak.html gives an introduction to the functions in the package.
